## Archivisk - Open Source Collaboration Space

Welcome to Archivisk! This repository is dedicated to developing an open-source collaboration space that bridges the gap between digital and physical workspaces, supporting creative work by providing intuitive and efficient tools.

#### About the Project

Archivisk is an evolving initiative aimed at creating seamless workflows between modular physical storage and digital documentation. We believe in open knowledge sharing and collaborative development to enhance coworking environments, whether at home, in companies, or within research institutions.

#### Our Vision

![One of our tools. A template for marking all dimensions. This allows the base plates and back panels to be produced in workshops without a CNC machine.](http://silaskuehn.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/P1025604-12-768x1023.jpg)

We are currently in the prototyping phase, working on building and refining the system with the help of our community. Our goal is to provide:

- An Obsidian Vault with structured templates to support documentation.
- The Archivisk Plug-in, which links ideas and research across projects while enhancing the intuitive display of the Obsidian Vault.
- Modular Storage System Designs, which will soon be available for makerspaces and individual creators to build and customize.

#### How to Get Involved

We invite you to follow our progress, contribute ideas, and help us improve both the digital and physical aspects of Archivisk. Whether you're interested in contributing code, design ideas, or testing prototypes, there's a place for you here!
