- **Raising Awareness:** Bias must be acknowledged and made conscious, whether in search engines, algorithms, or media.
    
- **Promoting Diversity:** Different perspectives and sources must be included to create a complete picture and reduce distortions.
    
- **Transparency and Accountability:** Algorithms and knowledge systems should be transparent, with clear accountability and regular checks for bias.
    
- **Alternative Archives:** Building archives with underrepresented perspectives helps actively combat biases.
    
- **Critical Reflection:** We should continuously question and adapt our knowledge and sources to recognize and minimize bias.
    

For us, this means the archive must be open, adaptable, and decentralized. Through Obsidian, adaptability and open structures are possible. It corrects references and backlinks no matter where they are changed, and the code is publicly available as an open-source project. Our Plugin Archivisk will also be open-source.  
With the help of the documentation on GitHub, we will raise awareness of discriminatory strategies and dynamics in archives.
