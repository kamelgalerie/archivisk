"Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism" by Safiya Umoja Noble, 2018

**Notes:**  
**Chapter 5**

- Google Alphabet  

- Jonathan Furner: _“admission on the part of designers that bias in classification schemes exists, and indeed is an inevitable result of the ways in which they are currently structured;”_ (Noble, 2018, p. 153)

 - _"recognition that adherence to a policy of neutrality will contribute little to eradication of that bias and indeed can only extend its life;"_ (Noble, 2018, p. 153) !!!

- _"construction, collection and analysis of narrative expressions of the feelings, thoughts, and beliefs of classification-scheme users who identify with particular racially-defined populations."_ (Noble, 2018, p. 153)

- impact of search engines and digital platforms on the future of public knowledge. She argues that the algorithms used by search engines often reinforce racist and discriminatory stereotypes, distorting public perception of knowledge. Noble emphasizes that these biases not only affect how information is accessed but also influence how power and knowledge are distributed in society, highlighting the responsibility of archives in this context.

- actively calls for archives to amplify alternative sources of knowledge and underrepresented perspectives. She argues that such archives could help correct dominant narrative distortions and create a more inclusive and equitable dissemination of knowledge. She underscores the necessity of viewing these archives as a form of resistance against the commercial control of information and as a tool for promoting social justice.
