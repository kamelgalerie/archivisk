Cladistics classifies organisms based on their evolutionary relationships. A clade includes a common ancestor and all its descendants, identified by shared characteristics (synapomorphies).

Phylogenetic trees illustrate these relationships by depicting evolutionary branching. This method is used for classification, biodiversity analysis, and studying evolutionary processes. Its limitations include incomplete data and the challenge of distinguishing between homologous and analogous traits.

Cladistics expands on Linnaean taxonomy by prioritizing evolutionary relationships over external characteristics. Using phylogenetic trees, it refines the classification of monophyletic groups, complementing or redefining Linnaeus' system.

In cladistics, "fish" is not considered a distinct group because it is not monophyletic. Traditional classifications include bony fish, cartilaginous fish, and jawless fish but exclude their descendants, such as amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, despite their evolutionary connection. Since cladistics groups only organisms that include all descendants of a common ancestor, "fish" as a category does not exist in this system.
