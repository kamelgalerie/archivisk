The Zettelkasten, made famous by sociologist Niklas Luhmann, is an analog system for organizing and linking knowledge. Luhmann developed this system in the 1960s to efficiently structure his research notes. The core idea of the Zettelkasten is to record each piece of information on an individual index card and connect it to others through references. This creates a network of thoughts that functions associatively rather than linearly.

A key element of the Zettelkasten is the numbering of notes. Luhmann used a hierarchical yet flexible structure that allowed him to insert new notes between existing ones without disrupting the order. Each note received a unique number that determined its position in the system. For example, a main note might be numbered "1," while a related thought could be added as "1a." A more specific thought could then be labeled "1a1." This method allows for mapping main topics, subtopics, and cross-connections.

To organize all physical materials in the cabinet system and link them to entries in the plugin, we adopt this numbering method. However, instead of using the pattern "1a1a1a1a," we use only numbers, separated by dots. This allows us to use a standard [number band stamp](./documentation/2 features/stamp.md).
