The **Collaboration Network** at the **University of the Arts London** illustrates how staff members are connected through shared research interests and projects. Similar to the [Graph View] in [Obsidian], it visualizes these connections as nodes linked by lines.

This makes interdisciplinary collaborations visible and facilitates the search for new partnerships. The network promotes exchange between different fields and helps identify synergies and common research areas.
