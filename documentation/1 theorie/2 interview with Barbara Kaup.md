We conducted a 50-minute interview with Barbara Kaup, focusing on how people store information. A key topic was the discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of labels. Barbara Kaup highlighted the impact of categories and labeling on knowledge storage and retrieval. Additionally, the topic of fish was revisited, providing further insights into handling specific information categories.

Barbara Kaup is a professor at the University of TÃ¼bingen, researching cognitive science, particularly mental representations and language processing. Her work provides valuable insights into how people categorize and retrieve information. This research is relevant to our project as it helps us develop effective structures for organizing and accessing information.

The full interview might be available in the vault at some time in german.
