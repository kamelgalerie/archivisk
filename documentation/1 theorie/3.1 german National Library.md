#Interview
In an interview with Stephanie Jacobs about the German National Library in Leipzig, the cataloging and archiving techniques of the 50 million books collected there were discussed. Based on the author, title, keywords, a continuous identification number, and many other categories, countless books in the shelving systems can be found. According to the "Numerus Curens" system, the books are sorted chronologically by the time of their entry into the shelf.
