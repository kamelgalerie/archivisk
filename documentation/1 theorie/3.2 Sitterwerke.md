The Werkbank (Workbench) of Sitterwerke is an experimental archive and inspiration format. The idea is based on an open, dynamic system that documents working materials, thought processes, and results.

The workbench allows for the continuous addition and restructuring of content without following a fixed hierarchy. It creates a kind of communal knowledge base that encourages collaborative work and the sharing of processes. The format resembles a physical archive or studio, where everything relevant to the work remains accessible at all times.

It consists of a workspace and the materials from the archive. On the workspace, materials, literature (text excerpts as well as open book pages), and personal notes can be collected. The entire surface is then scanned and transformed into a digital workbench, which can be used interactively online. Our [canvas](./documentation/2 features/4 canvas.md) is also inspired by this Werkbank.
